description: "The History of Ryanair's Boarding Pass The humble boarding pass, up until the mid 2000's was just a simple document to get you from the check-in desk to your airplane seat. Gate Number? Check. Seat Number? Check. Ample time to peruse the shops and sip a fine Italian macchiato while you waited for flight number to be called."
