    description: "\"Design is everywhere, inevitably everyone is a designer,\" says Tim Brown of IDEO. That's something we've heard time and time again. Because if you're a problem solver, you're a designer. Even Don Norman, who coined the term \"user experience,\" says that everyone is a designer. As he writes: \"We are all designers."

description: "To many designers, consistency doesn't scream sexy. But to anyone with an understanding of user experience, there couldn't be a bigger turn on. We should design with this in mind. Anyone who tells you their product was a success because of the intuitive design they created is overselling their skills."
