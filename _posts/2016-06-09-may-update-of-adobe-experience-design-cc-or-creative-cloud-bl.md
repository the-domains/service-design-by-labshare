      Google has acquired mobile app prototyping tool Pixate today, both
      companies have confirmed. Pixate had raised $3.8M from Accel Partners in
      2013. It had popped out of the Y-Combinator oven previously (YC S12).
      Here's what the Pixate CEO Paul Colton shared on their blog about the move
      today: Today, I am very proud to announce that Pixate has joined Google's
      design team.
