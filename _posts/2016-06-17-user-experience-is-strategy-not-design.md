  User experience, when addressed appropriately, is an holistic endeavor. The
  emerging conversation of " cross-channel user experience " is redundant,
  because if you're weren't thinking cross-channel (and cross-platform,
  cross-device, etc. etc.), you were doing "user experience" wrong. As the
  holism of user experience becomes more broadly realized, something else
  becomes clear.
