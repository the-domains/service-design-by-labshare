            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Priority Queue - Designing Ryanair's Boarding Pass</h1><p>The History of Ryanair's Boarding Pass The humble boarding pass, up until the mid 2000's was just a simple document to get you from the check-in desk to your airplane seat. Gate Number? Check. Seat Number? Check. Ample time to peruse the shops and sip a fine Italian macchiato while you waited for flight number to be called.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/98bbe2df0ffc320998fde5f029fc1c5773c16ba6.jpg"></article>]]></description>
