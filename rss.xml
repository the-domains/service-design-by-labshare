            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Priority Queue - Designing Ryanair's Boarding Pass</h1><p>The History of Ryanair's Boarding Pass The humble boarding pass, up until the mid 2000's was just a simple document to get you from the check-in desk to your airplane seat. Gate Number? Check. Seat Number? Check. Ample time to peruse the shops and sip a fine Italian macchiato while you waited for flight number to be called.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/98bbe2df0ffc320998fde5f029fc1c5773c16ba6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>In defense of the Uber-ization of everything</h1><p>I recently posted on Facebook a short rant about digital transformation for established enterprises. The skinny is that there are endless amounts of why and barely no opining on the what or how when it comes to executing any kind of digital transformation of your business or industry.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/36eb8f28c44ffcb2c812abcaaf278a04/noop?input=https%3A%2F%2Ftctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com%2F2016%2F06%2Fuber-everywhere.png%26h%3D400%26crop%3D1"></article>]]></description>

You're a new service designer, in a new role, and you're on a mission to build out capacity, create capability, and deliver on whatever promise it's assumed service design makes. Maybe those things were asked of you.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/80c575b0ccd6461812103dcb20c40fe5b6e4d4f9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>User experience is strategy, not design</h1><p>User experience, when addressed appropriately, is an holistic endeavor. The emerging conversation of " cross-channel user experience " is redundant, because if you're weren't thinking cross-channel (and cross-platform, cross-device, etc. etc.), you were doing "user experience" wrong. As the holism of user experience becomes more broadly realized, something else becomes clear.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/334e6f26a27868da2d99258bfceb234c0b2f1842.jpg"></article>]]></description>
