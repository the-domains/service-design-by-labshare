But often, we can all agree on something that isn't beautiful. For example, the zombies from Walking Dead, that strange conjoined twin thing from Total Recall, and a really poorly designed email.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/eb75fa6a1b80a6083df24598d3a6a752ed610406.jpg"></article>]]></description>

I thought, "Wow. That's pretty cool!" and started searching online to purchase one myself. When I looked at the cost of an IOHawk at $1,800 or the Phunkeeduck at $1,500, I thought there had to be a cheaper way.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e6dff19fb64eb07c3f2e3bae207b3005fdaec3e5.jpg"></article>]]></description>
