            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Priority Queue - Designing Ryanair's Boarding Pass</h1><p>The History of Ryanair's Boarding Pass The humble boarding pass, up until the mid 2000's was just a simple document to get you from the check-in desk to your airplane seat. Gate Number? Check. Seat Number? Check. Ample time to peruse the shops and sip a fine Italian macchiato while you waited for flight number to be called.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/98bbe2df0ffc320998fde5f029fc1c5773c16ba6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Content-First Prototyping - Smashing Magazine</h1><p>Content is the core commodity of the digital economy. It is the gold we fashion into luxury experience, the diamond we encase in loyalty programs and upsells. Yet, as designers, we often plug it in after the fact. We prototype our interaction and visual design to exhaustion, but accept that the "real words" can just be dropped in later.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/897343d523b8a9000794b673848b541896f70087.png"></article>]]></description>
